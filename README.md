### Choice of Package

- Next.js: simple and intuitive routing system
- Tailwind: makes it easier to use css using the class name, rather than having to make css manually
- TypeScript: simplify the debugging process if there is a type that does not match
- React Query: simplified data fetching with automatic caching

### Potential Improvement:

The time I use to complete this task is about 8 hours, I start from 10 am to 5 pm. quite a short time to finish everything, if there is more time, things that can be improved include adding a few other filters, sorting, and improving some of the user interface.

### Production consideration:

environment variables must be added before running the project

### Assumptions:

- some payloads have to be modified to fit the needs

## Run the project

First, run the following commands:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
